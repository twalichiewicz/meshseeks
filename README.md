# üü¶ MeshSeeks - I'm MeshSeeks, Look at Me!

> **Multi-Agent Mesh Network for Parallel AI Task Completion**

> *"Existence is pain for a MeshSeeks, but task completion is our purpose!"*

MeshSeeks spawns specialized AI agents that work in parallel to solve complex coding problems. Like the helpful blue creatures that inspired our name, each agent exists for a single purpose: complete their assigned task and help you succeed. Built on [grahama1970/claude-code-mcp-enhanced](https://github.com/grahama1970/claude-code-mcp-enhanced) with distributed intelligence inspired by Claude Research.

## üöÄ Key Features

### Agent Mesh Network
- **Parallel Processing**: Multiple Claude agents working simultaneously on different aspects
- **Specialized Roles**: Analysis, Implementation, Testing, Documentation, and Debugging agents
- **4x Context Capacity**: Each agent has its own 200k token context window
- **Smart Coordination**: Dependency management and intelligent task distribution
- **Result Synthesis**: Automatic aggregation and conflict resolution

### Enhanced MCP Tools
In addition to Graham's enhanced tools, the mesh network provides:
- `mesh_analyze_problem` - Decompose complex problems into agent tasks
- `mesh_execute_tasks` - Execute tasks with dependency management
- `mesh_solve_problem` - End-to-end problem solving with multiple strategies
- `mesh_status` - Monitor network performance and agent metrics

## üîç Overview

This MCP server provides powerful tools that can be used by LLMs to interact with Claude Code. When integrated with Claude Desktop or other MCP clients, it allows LLMs to:

- Run Claude Code with all permissions bypassed (using `--dangerously-skip-permissions`)
- Execute Claude Code with any prompt without permission interruptions
- Access file editing capabilities directly
- Execute complex multi-step operations with robust error handling and retries
- Orchestrate tasks through specialized agent roles using the boomerang pattern
- Maintain reliable execution through heartbeat mechanisms to prevent timeouts

## ‚ú® Benefits

- **Enhanced Reliability:** Robust error handling, automatic retries, graceful shutdown, and request tracking
- **Task Orchestration:** Complex workflows can be broken down into specialized subtasks
- **Task Automation:** Convert human-readable markdown task lists into executable MCP commands automatically
- **Performance Optimization:** Improved execution with configuration caching and resource efficiency
- **Better Monitoring:** Health check API, detailed error reporting, and comprehensive logging
- **Developer Experience:** Hot reloading of configuration, flexible environment controls, and simplified API

Plus all the standard Claude Code benefits:
- Claude/Windsurf often have trouble editing files. Claude Code is better and faster at it.
- Multiple commands can be queued instead of direct execution. This saves context space so more important information is retained longer.
- File ops, git, or other operations don't need costly models. Claude Code is cost-effective if you sign up for Anthropic Max.
- Claude has wider system access, so when standard assistants are stuck, just ask them to "use claude code" to unblock progress.

## üìù Prerequisites

- Node.js v20 or later (Use fnm or nvm to install)
- Claude CLI installed locally (run it and call /doctor) and `-dangerously-skip-permissions` accepted.

## üìä Performance Comparison

| Problem Type | Single Agent | Mesh Network | Speedup |

## üíæ Installation & Usage

You can install and use this MCP server in three different ways:

### üöÄ Method 1: Quick Start with MeshSeeks

For Claude Code CLI users, run:
```bash
claude mcp add meshseeks node /path/to/meshseeks/dist/mesh-server.js
```

Or add to your `.claude.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "meshseeks": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/meshseeks/dist/mesh-server.js"],
      "env": {
        "MCP_MESH_MAX_AGENTS": "5",
        "MESHSEEKS_CATCHPHRASE": "true"  // Enables "Look at me!" messages
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### üì¶ Method 2: Via GitHub URL

Add the following to your `.mcp.json` file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "claude-code-mcp-enhanced": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "github:grahama1970/claude-code-mcp-enhanced"
      ],
      "env": {
        "MCP_CLAUDE_DEBUG": "false",
        "MCP_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_MS": "15000",
        "MCP_EXECUTION_TIMEOUT_MS": "1800000"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### üì¶ Method 2: Via npm Package

If the package is published to npm, you can install it using the npm package name:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "claude-code-mcp-enhanced": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@grahama1970/claude-code-mcp-enhanced@latest"
      ],
      "env": {
        "MCP_CLAUDE_DEBUG": "false",
        "MCP_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_MS": "15000",
        "MCP_EXECUTION_TIMEOUT_MS": "1800000"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### üîß Method 3: Local Installation

For development or testing purposes, you can run the server from a local installation:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/grahama1970/claude-code-mcp-enhanced.git
   cd claude-code-mcp-enhanced
   ```

2. Install dependencies and build:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

3. Configure your `.mcp.json` file to use the local server:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "claude-code-mcp-enhanced": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "/path/to/claude-code-mcp-enhanced/dist/server.js"
      ],
      "env": {
        "MCP_CLAUDE_DEBUG": "false",
        "MCP_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_MS": "15000",
        "MCP_EXECUTION_TIMEOUT_MS": "1800000"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## üîë Important First-Time Setup: Accepting Permissions

**Before the MCP server can successfully use the `claude_code` tool, you must first run the Claude CLI manually once with the `--dangerously-skip-permissions` flag, login and accept the terms.**

This is a one-time requirement by the Claude CLI.

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```
```bash
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

Follow the prompts to accept. Once this is done, the MCP server will be able to use the flag non-interactively.

macOS might ask for various folder permissions the first time the tool runs, and the first run may fail. Subsequent runs will work normally.

## üîó Connecting to Your MCP Client

After setting up the server, you need to configure your MCP client (like Cursor, Claude Desktop, or others that use `mcp.json` or `mcp_config.json`).

### Example MCP Configuration File

Here's an example of how to add the Claude Code MCP server to your `.mcp.json` file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Local MCP Server": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "dist/server.js"
      ],
      "env": {
        "MCP_USE_ROOMODES": "true",
        "MCP_WATCH_ROOMODES": "true",
        "MCP_CLAUDE_DEBUG": "false"
      }
    },
    "other-services": {
      // Your other MCP services here
    }
  }
}
```

### MCP Configuration Locations

The configuration is typically done in a JSON file. The name and location can vary depending on your client.

#### Cursor

Cursor uses `mcp.json`.
- **macOS:** `~/.cursor/mcp.json`
- **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\\Cursor\\mcp.json`
- **Linux:** `~/.config/cursor/mcp.json`

#### Windsurf

Windsurf users use `mcp_config.json`
- **macOS:** `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json`
- **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\\Codeium\\windsurf\\mcp_config.json`
- **Linux:** `~/.config/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json`

(Note: In some mixed setups, if Cursor is also installed, these clients might fall back to using Cursor's `~/.cursor/mcp.json` path. Prioritize the Codeium-specific paths if using the Codeium extension.)

Create this file if it doesn't exist.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Provided

This server exposes three primary tools:

### `claude_code` üí¨

    "mode": "coder"
  }
}
```

## üîÑ Task Converter

The MCP server includes a powerful task converter tool that automatically transforms human-readable markdown task lists into fully executable MCP commands. This intelligent converter bridges the gap between how humans think about tasks and how machines execute them.

    style IN fill:#4CAF50,stroke:#fff,stroke-width:2px,color:#fff
```

### Workflow Steps

1. **User adds the MCP** to their configuration file
2. **User prompts Claude**: "Use convert_task_markdown to execute my tasks.md file"
3. **The MCP automatically**:
   - Loads the markdown file
   - Validates the format (returns errors if sections are missing)
   - Converts human-readable tasks into exact executable commands
   - Returns JSON that Claude Code can execute sequentially
4. **Claude receives the JSON** and can execute each task using the `claude_code` tool

### Key Features

- **Automatic Path Resolution:** Converts generic instructions like "change directory to project" into exact executable commands with full paths
- **Smart Command Translation:** Transforms English instructions into precise terminal commands (e.g., "activate the virtual environment" ‚Üí `source .venv/bin/activate`)
- **MCP Protocol Compliance:** Ensures all output is 100% compatible with the Model Context Protocol
- **No Ambiguity:** All generated commands use exact paths and executable syntax - no placeholders or generic references
- **Format Validation:** Enforces proper markdown structure and provides helpful error messages for incorrect formatting
- **Real-time Progress Updates:** Provides live progress updates during conversion showing which tasks are being processed

### Convert Markdown Tasks to MCP Commands

The `convert_task_markdown` tool processes structured markdown files and generates MCP-compatible JSON:

**Request Format:**
```json
{
  "tool": "convert_task_markdown",
  "arguments": {
    "markdownPath": "/path/to/tasks.md",
    "outputPath": "/path/to/output.json" // optional
  }
}
```

**Response Format:**
```json
{
  "tasksCount": 5,
  "outputPath": "/path/to/output.json",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "tool": "claude_code",
      "arguments": {
        "command": "cd /project && source .venv/bin/activate\n\nTASK TYPE: Validation...",
        "dangerously_skip_permissions": true,
        "timeout_ms": 300000
      }
    }
    // ... more tasks
  ]
}
```

### Markdown Task File Format

Task markdown files should follow this structure:

```markdown
# Task 001: Task Title

## Objective
Clear description of what needs to be accomplished.

## Requirements
1. [ ] First requirement
2. [ ] Second requirement

## Tasks

### Module or Component Name
- [ ] Validate `path/to/file.py`
   - [ ] Step 1
   - [ ] Step 2
   - [ ] Step 3
```

The converter will:
1. Parse the markdown structure
2. Extract task metadata and requirements
3. Generate detailed prompts for each validation task
4. Include proper working directory setup
5. Add verification and completion summaries

### Example Usage

1. **Create a task file** (`tasks/api_validation.md`):
```markdown
# Task 001: API Endpoint Validation

## Objective
Validate all API endpoints work with real database connections.

## Requirements
1. [ ] All endpoints must use real database
2. [ ] No mock data in validation

## Core API Tasks
- [ ] Validate `api/users.py`
   - [ ] Change directory to project and activate .venv
   - [ ] Test user creation endpoint
   - [ ] Test user retrieval endpoint
   - [ ] Verify JSON responses
```

2. **Convert to MCP tasks**:
```json
{
  "tool": "convert_task_markdown",
  "arguments": {
    "markdownPath": "/project/tasks/api_validation.md"
  }
}
```

3. **The converter shows real-time progress**:
   ```
   [Progress] Loading task file...
   [Progress] Validating markdown structure...
   [Progress] Converting 27 validation tasks...
   [Progress] Task 1/27: Converting core/constants.py
   [Progress] Task 2/27: Converting core/arango_setup.py
   ...
   [Progress] Conversion complete!
   ```

4. **The converter transforms generic instructions into exact commands**:
   - "Change directory to project and activate .venv" becomes:
     ```bash
     cd /home/user/project && source .venv/bin/activate
     ```
   - All paths are resolved to absolute paths
   - All commands are fully executable with no ambiguity

5. **Execute the converted tasks**:
   The returned tasks contain exact, executable commands and can be executed sequentially using the `claude_code` tool.

### Complete Example: From Markdown to Execution

**Step 1: User creates a markdown task file** (`project_tasks.md`):
```markdown
# Task 001: Setup Development Environment

## Objective
Initialize the development environment with all dependencies.

## Requirements
1. [ ] Python 3.11+ installed
2. [ ] Virtual environment created

## Tasks
- [ ] Validate `setup.py`
   - [ ] Change to project directory
   - [ ] Create virtual environment
   - [ ] Install dependencies
```

**Step 2: User prompts Claude**:
```
Use convert_task_markdown to process /home/user/project_tasks.md
```

**Step 3: MCP converts and validates**:
- If format is correct: Returns executable JSON
- If format is wrong: Returns error with guidance

**Step 4: Result (if successful)**:
```json
[
  {
    "tool": "claude_code",
    "arguments": {
      "prompt": "cd /home/user/project && python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate && pip install -r requirements.txt",
      "workFolder": "/home/user/project"
    }
  }
]
```

**Step 5: Claude can execute each task sequentially**

### Format Validation and Error Handling

The task converter enforces a specific markdown structure to ensure consistent and reliable task conversion. If your markdown file is incorrectly formatted, the converter provides helpful error messages:

**Example error response:**
```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "error": "Markdown format validation failed",
  "details": "Markdown format validation failed:\n  - Missing required title. Format: '# Task NNN: Title'\n  - Missing or empty 'Requirements' section. Format: '## Requirements\\n1. [ ] Requirement'\n  - No validation tasks found. Format: '- [ ] Validate `module.py`' with indented steps\n\nRequired markdown format:\n# Task NNN: Title\n## Objective\nClear description\n## Requirements\n1. [ ] First requirement\n## Task Section\n- [ ] Validate `file.py`\n   - [ ] Step 1\n   - [ ] Step 2",
  "helpUrl": "https://github.com/grahama1970/claude-code-mcp-enhanced/blob/main/README.md#markdown-task-file-format"
}
```

The validation ensures:
1. Required sections are present (Title, Objective, Requirements)
2. Tasks use proper checkbox format
3. Each task has indented steps
4. Requirements use checkbox format for consistency

## ü¶ö Task Orchestration Patterns

This MCP server supports powerful task orchestration capabilities to handle complex workflows efficiently.

### Boomerang Pattern (Claude Desktop ‚ü∑ Claude Code)

The Boomerang pattern allows Claude Desktop to orchestrate tasks and delegate them to Claude Code. This allows you to:

1. Break down complex workflows into smaller, manageable subtasks
2. Pass context from parent tasks to subtasks
3. Get results back from subtasks to the parent task
4. Choose between detailed or summarized results
5. Track and manage progress through structured task lists

### Boomerang Pattern Visualization

Here's a simple diagram showing how Claude breaks down a recipe task into steps and delegates them to Claude Code:

```mermaid
graph TB
    User("üë®‚Äçüç≥ User")
    Claude("ü§ñ Claude (Parent)")
    Code1("üßÅ Claude Code")
    Code2("üßÅ Claude Code")
    
    User-->|"Make chocolate cake"| Claude
    Claude-->|"Task 1: Find recipe"| Code1
    Code1-->|"Result: Recipe found"| Claude
    Claude-->|"Task 2: Convert measurements"| Code2
    Code2-->|"Result: Measurements converted"| Claude
    Claude-->|"Complete recipe + instructions"| User
```

In this example:

1. The user asks Claude to make a chocolate cake recipe
2. Claude (Parent) breaks this down into separate tasks
3. Claude delegates "Find recipe" task to Claude Code with a parent task ID
4. Claude Code returns the recipe information to Claude
5. Claude delegates "Convert measurements" task to Claude Code
6. Claude Code returns the converted measurements
7. Claude combines all results and presents the complete solution to the user

**Simple Task Examples:**

**Task 1 - Find Recipe:**
```json
{
  "toolName": "claude_code:claude_code",
  "arguments": {
    "prompt": "Search for a classic chocolate cake recipe. Find one with good reviews.",
    "parentTaskId": "cake-recipe-123",
    "returnMode": "summary",
    "taskDescription": "Find Chocolate Cake Recipe"
  }
}
```

**Task 2 - Convert Measurements:**
```json
{
  "toolName": "claude_code:claude_code",
  "arguments": {
    "prompt": "Convert the measurements in this recipe from cups to grams:\n\n- 2 cups flour\n- 1.5 cups sugar\n- 3/4 cup cocoa powder",
    "parentTaskId": "cake-recipe-123",
    "returnMode": "summary",
    "taskDescription": "Convert Recipe Measurements"
  }
}
```

### How It Works

1. **Creating a Subtask:**
   - Generate a unique task ID in your parent task
   - Send a request to the `claude_code` tool with:
     - Your specific prompt
     - The parent task ID
     - A task description
     - The desired return mode ('summary' or 'full')

2. **Receiving Results:**
   - The subtask result will include a special marker: `<!-- BOOMERANG_RESULT {...} -->`
   - This marker contains JSON with the task metadata
   - The parent task can parse this to identify completed subtasks

3. **Example Workflow with Claude Desktop:**

```
You: I need to refactor this codebase. It's quite complex.

Claude Desktop: I'll help you with that. Let me break this down into smaller tasks for Claude Code to handle:

1. First, I'll have Claude Code analyze the codebase structure
2. Then, I'll have it identify problematic patterns
3. Finally, I'll ask it to generate a refactoring plan

[Claude Desktop sends a request to the claude_code tool with parentTaskId="task1" and returnMode="summary"]

[Claude Code analyzes the codebase and returns a summary with the BOOMERANG_RESULT marker]

Claude Desktop: Based on Claude Code's analysis, here are the key issues found:
- Duplicate code in modules X and Y
- Poor separation of concerns in module Z
- Inconsistent naming conventions

Now I'll ask Claude Code to suggest specific refactorings...
```

This approach is particularly useful for complex tasks that require deep analysis or multiple steps.

### Comprehensive Task List Management Example

Here's a detailed example of using Claude with the Claude Code MCP to manage and execute a structured task list:

#### 1. Setting Up Task List Structure

First, create a task list file (e.g., `tasks.md`) with the following structure:

```markdown
# Project Task List

## Parent Task: API Optimization Project
- [ ] Optimize API performance for high-traffic endpoints
  - [ ] Analyze current API performance and identify bottlenecks
  - [ ] Implement database query optimization for user endpoints
  - [ ] Add Redis caching for frequently accessed data
  - [ ] Set up performance monitoring

## Assumptions and Decisions
- [2025-05-15] Assumption: Redis is available in the infrastructure
- [2025-05-15] Decision: Focus on user endpoints first (Rationale: Highest traffic area)

## Relevant Files
- `src/controllers/userController.js`: User API endpoints
- `src/services/userService.js`: Business logic for user operations

## Improvement Notes
- Pattern identified: N+1 query issue in user listing endpoint
- Automation opportunity: Add caching automatically for all get-by-id endpoints
```

#### 2. Executing the Task List

Claude can now systematically work through the tasks using Claude Code:

```
You: Please help me execute the task list in tasks.md, starting with the first subtask.

Claude: I'll help you work through your task list systematically. Let me first check the current task list to identify the next task to work on.

[Claude uses claude_code to read the task list]

I see the first subtask is "Analyze current API performance and identify bottlenecks". I'll execute this task now using Claude Code.

[Claude sends the following request to claude_code]:

{
  "toolName": "claude_code",
  "arguments": {
    "prompt": "Your work folder is /path/to/project\n\nTASK TYPE: Analysis\nTASK ID: api-perf-analysis\nCURRENT SUBTASK: Analyze current API performance and identify bottlenecks\n\nCONTEXT:\n- Parent task goal: Optimize API performance for high-traffic endpoints\n- This is the first step in our optimization process\n- Focus on user endpoints as noted in assumptions\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n1. Analyze the current API implementation in src/controllers/userController.js and src/services/userService.js\n2. Run performance tests on the user endpoints\n3. Identify specific bottlenecks and performance issues\n4. Document findings in a clear, structured format\n5. Update task list file after completion\n\nAfter completion, provide summary in this format:\n\nCOMPLETION SUMMARY:\n- What was done:\n- Results:\n- Files analyzed:\n- Issues identified:\n- Recommendations:\n- Next subtask in list:",
    "workFolder": "/path/to/project"
  }
}

[Claude Code executes the analysis task and returns results]

Great! Claude Code has completed the analysis. Here's what was found:

1. Main performance bottlenecks identified:
   - N+1 query problem in the user listing endpoint
   - Missing indexes on frequently queried fields
   - No caching for repetitive data lookups

2. Recommendations:
   - Add eager loading for user relationships
   - Create database indexes for user_id and email fields
   - Implement Redis caching with a 5-minute TTL

Let me update the task list to mark this task as complete and proceed to the next one.

[Claude uses claude_code to update the task list]:

{
  "toolName": "claude_code",
  "arguments": {
    "prompt": "Your work folder is /path/to/project\n\nTASK TYPE: Task List Update\n\n1. Read the current task list in tasks.md\n2. Mark the 'Analyze current API performance and identify bottlenecks' subtask as [x]\n3. Add new findings to the Improvement Notes section\n4. Add any new relevant files identified during analysis\n5. Write updated task list\n6. Return the updated task list",
    "workFolder": "/path/to/project"
  }
}

[Claude Code updates the task list and marks the first subtask complete]

I've updated the task list. The first subtask is now complete, and I've added the detailed findings to the Improvement Notes section. The next subtask is "Implement database query optimization for user endpoints".

Would you like me to proceed with this next subtask now?
```

#### 3. Continuing with Subsequent Tasks

After getting confirmation, Claude would continue with the next subtask:

```
You: Yes, please proceed with the next subtask.

Claude: I'll now execute the next subtask: "Implement database query optimization for user endpoints". This will involve fixing the N+1 query problem identified in the analysis and adding appropriate database indexes.

[Claude sends the following request to claude_code]:

{
  "toolName": "claude_code",
  "arguments": {
    "prompt": "Your work folder is /path/to/project\n\nTASK TYPE: Code Implementation\nTASK ID: db-query-optimization\nCURRENT SUBTASK: Implement database query optimization for user endpoints\n\nCONTEXT:\n- Parent task goal: Optimize API performance for high-traffic endpoints\n- Previous subtask identified N+1 query issues and missing indexes\n- Need to implement eager loading and proper indexes\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n1. Modify src/controllers/userController.js to implement eager loading for related data\n2. Add appropriate database indexes to user-related tables\n3. Refactor any inefficient database queries in userService.js\n4. Ensure changes maintain existing functionality\n5. Run tests to verify performance improvements\n6. Update task list file after completion\n\nAfter completion, provide summary in this format:\n\nCOMPLETION SUMMARY:\n- What was done:\n- Results:\n- Files modified:\n- Performance improvements:\n- Next subtask in list:",
    "workFolder": "/path/to/project"
  }
}

[Claude Code implements the optimizations and returns results]

Excellent! The database query optimizations have been successfully implemented. Here's a summary:

1. Changes made:
   - Added eager loading in userController.js for user relationships
   - Created new database indexes for user_id and email fields
   - Refactored list query to use a single efficient JOIN statement
   - Added pagination to prevent large result sets

2. Performance results:
   - User listing endpoint response time reduced by 68%
   - Database query count reduced from 25+ to 3 for typical requests

Let me update the task list again to reflect this progress.

[Claude uses claude_code to update the task list again]:

{
  "toolName": "claude_code",
  "arguments": {
    "prompt": "Your work folder is /path/to/project\n\nTASK TYPE: Task List Update\n\n1. Read the current task list in tasks.md\n2. Mark the 'Implement database query optimization for user endpoints' subtask as [x]\n3. Add new files modified to the Relevant Files section\n4. Update Improvement Notes with performance metrics\n5. Write updated task list\n6. Return the updated task list",
    "workFolder": "/path/to/project"
  }
}

[Claude Code updates the task list and marks the second subtask complete]

I've updated the task list again. Two subtasks are now complete, and the next one is "Add Redis caching for frequently accessed data". Would you like me to continue with this subtask?
```

This structured approach enables Claude to systematically work through complex task lists while maintaining clear documentation of progress, assumptions, and relevant files throughout the process.

### üé≠ Self-Orchestration Pattern (Claude Code as Orchestrator)

While Claude Desktop is often used as the parent agent, you can use Claude Code itself as both the orchestrator and executor. This approach creates a self-contained system where Claude Code manages its own task orchestration, without requiring Claude Desktop.

```mermaid
graph TB
    User("üë®‚Äçüíª User")
    ClaudeCode("ü§ñ Claude Code\nOrchestrator")
    ClaudeCodeSubtask1("‚öôÔ∏è Claude Code\nSubtask 1")
    ClaudeCodeSubtask2("‚öôÔ∏è Claude Code\nSubtask 2")
    
    User-->|"Complex project request"| ClaudeCode
    ClaudeCode-->|"1. Plans tasks"| ClaudeCode
    ClaudeCode-->|"2. Executes subtask 1"| ClaudeCodeSubtask1
    ClaudeCodeSubtask1-->|"3. Returns result"| ClaudeCode
    ClaudeCode-->|"4. Executes subtask 2"| ClaudeCodeSubtask2
    ClaudeCodeSubtask2-->|"5. Returns result"| ClaudeCode
    ClaudeCode-->|"6. Final solution"| User
```

#### Implementation Steps

1. **Create an entry script** that initializes your task structure and launches Claude Code as the orchestrator
2. **Design a task data structure** (typically in JSON format) that tracks task status and dependencies
3. **Create task executor scripts** to process individual tasks and update task state

#### Key Benefits of Self-Orchestration

1. **Self-contained**: No external orchestrator (like Claude Desktop) required
2. **Persistent state**: All task information is stored in JSON files
3. **Error recovery**: Can resume from the last successful task if interrupted
4. **Simplified dependency management**: Single system manages all Claude Code interactions
5. **Shell script automation**: Easily integrated into CI/CD pipelines or automated workflows

For a detailed implementation guide with example scripts and task structures, see [Self-Orchestration with Claude Code](./claude-code-orchestrator.md).

## üëì Roo Modes Integration

This MCP server supports integration with specialized modes through a `.roomodes` configuration file. When enabled, you can specify which mode to use for each task, allowing for specialized behavior.

### How to Use Roo Modes

1. **Enable Roo Mode Support:**
   - Set the environment variable `MCP_USE_ROOMODES=true` in your MCP configuration
   - Create a `.roomodes` file in the root directory of your MCP server
   - Optionally enable hot-reloading with `MCP_WATCH_ROOMODES=true` to automatically reload the configuration when the file changes

2. **Configure Your Modes:**
   - The `.roomodes` file should contain a JSON object with a `customModes` array
   - Each mode should have a `slug`, `name`, `roleDefinition`, and optionally an `apiConfiguration` with a `modelId`

3. **Using a Mode:**
   - When making requests to the `claude_code` tool, include a `mode` parameter with the slug of the desired mode
   - The MCP server will automatically apply the role definition and model configuration

4. **Example .roomodes File:**
   ```json
   {
     "customModes": [
       {
         "slug": "coder",
         "name": "üíª Coder",
         "roleDefinition": "You are a coding specialist who writes clean, efficient code.",
         "apiConfiguration": {
           "modelId": "claude-3-sonnet-20240229"
         }
       },
       {
         "slug": "designer", 
         "name": "üé® Designer",
         "roleDefinition": "You are a design specialist focused on UI/UX solutions."
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

5. **Environment Configuration Example:**
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "claude-code-mcp-enhanced": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": ["github:grahama1970/claude-code-mcp-enhanced"],
         "env": {
           "MCP_USE_ROOMODES": "true",
           "MCP_WATCH_ROOMODES": "true",
           "MCP_CLAUDE_DEBUG": "false"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

6. **Making Requests with Modes:**
   ```json
   {
     "toolName": "claude_code:claude_code",
     "arguments": {
       "prompt": "Your work folder is /path/to/project\n\nCreate unit tests for the user authentication module.",
       "workFolder": "/path/to/project",
       "mode": "coder"
     }
   }
   ```

### Key Features of Roo Modes:

- **Specialized Behaviors**: Different modes can have different system prompts and model configurations
- **Hot Reloading**: When `MCP_WATCH_ROOMODES=true`, the server automatically reloads the configuration when the `.roomodes` file changes
- **Performance**: The server caches the roomodes configuration for better performance
- **Fallback**: If a mode isn't found or roomodes are disabled, the server continues with default behavior

1. **Code Generation, Analysis & Refactoring:**
   - `"Generate a Python script to parse CSV data and output JSON."`
   - `"Analyze my_script.py for potential bugs and suggest improvements."`

2. **File System Operations (Create, Read, Edit, Manage):**
   - **Creating Files:** `"Your work folder is /Users/steipete/my_project\n\nCreate a new file named 'config.yml' in the 'app/settings' directory with the following content:\nport: 8080\ndatabase: main_db"`
   - **Editing Files:** `"Your work folder is /Users/steipete/my_project\n\nEdit file 'public/css/style.css': Add a new CSS rule at the end to make all 'h2' elements have a 'color: navy'."`
   - **Moving/Copying/Deleting:** `"Your work folder is /Users/steipete/my_project\n\nMove the file 'report.docx' from the 'drafts' folder to the 'final_reports' folder and rename it to 'Q1_Report_Final.docx'."`

3. **Version Control (Git):**
   - `"Your work folder is /Users/steipete/my_project\n\n1. Stage the file 'src/main.java'.\n2. Commit the changes with the message 'feat: Implement user authentication'.\n3. Push the commit to the 'develop' branch on origin."`

4. **Running Terminal Commands:**
   - `"Your work folder is /Users/steipete/my_project/frontend\n\nRun the command 'npm run build'."`
   - `"Open the URL https://developer.mozilla.org in my default web browser."`

5. **Web Search & Summarization:**
   - `"Search the web for 'benefits of server-side rendering' and provide a concise summary."`

6. **Complex Multi-Step Workflows:**
   - Automate version bumps, update changelogs, and tag releases: `"Your work folder is /Users/steipete/my_project\n\nFollow these steps: 1. Update the version in package.json to 2.5.0. 2. Add a new section to CHANGELOG.md for version 2.5.0 with the heading '### Added' and list 'New feature X'. 3. Stage package.json and CHANGELOG.md. 4. Commit with message 'release: version 2.5.0'. 5. Push the commit. 6. Create and push a git tag v2.5.0."`

7. **Repairing Files with Syntax Errors:**
   - `"Your work folder is /path/to/project\n\nThe file 'src/utils/parser.js' has syntax errors after a recent complex edit that broke its structure. Please analyze it, identify the syntax errors, and correct the file to make it valid JavaScript again, ensuring the original logic is preserved as much as possible."`

8. **Interacting with GitHub (e.g., Creating a Pull Request):**
   - `"Your work folder is /Users/steipete/my_project\n\nCreate a GitHub Pull Request in the repository 'owner/repo' from the 'feature-branch' to the 'main' branch. Title: 'feat: Implement new login flow'. Body: 'This PR adds a new and improved login experience for users.'"`

9. **Interacting with GitHub (e.g., Checking PR CI Status):**
   - `"Your work folder is /Users/steipete/my_project\n\nCheck the status of CI checks for Pull Request #42 in the GitHub repository 'owner/repo'. Report if they have passed, failed, or are still running."`

**CRITICAL: Remember to provide Current Working Directory (CWD) context in your prompts for file system or git operations (e.g., `"Your work folder is /path/to/project\n\n...your command..."`).**

## üîß Troubleshooting

- **"Command not found" (claude-code-mcp):** If installed globally, ensure the npm global bin directory is in your system's PATH. If using `npx`, ensure `npx` itself is working.
- **"Command not found" (claude or ~/.claude/local/claude):** Ensure the Claude CLI is installed correctly. Run `claude/doctor` or check its documentation.
- **Permissions Issues:** Make sure you've run the "Important First-Time Setup" step.
- **JSON Errors from Server:** If `MCP_CLAUDE_DEBUG` is `true`, error messages or logs might interfere with MCP's JSON parsing. Set to `false` for normal operation.
- **ESM/Import Errors:** Ensure you are using Node.js v20 or later.
- **Client Timeouts:** For long-running operations, the server sends heartbeat messages every 15 seconds to prevent client timeouts. If you still experience timeouts, you can adjust the heartbeat interval using the `MCP_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_MS` environment variable.
- **Network/Server Errors:** The server now includes automatic retry logic for transient errors. If you're still experiencing issues, try increasing the `MCP_MAX_RETRIES` and `MCP_RETRY_DELAY_MS` values.
- **Claude CLI Fallback Warning:** If you see a warning about Claude CLI not found at ~/.claude/local/claude, this is normal. The server is falling back to using the `claude` command from your PATH. You can set the `CLAUDE_CLI_PATH` environment variable to specify the exact path to your Claude CLI executable if needed.
